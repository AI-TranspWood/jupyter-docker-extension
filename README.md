# AITW-JupyterLab Docker Extension

This is a Docker Extension aimed at facilitating the access of [AI-TranspWood](https://www.ai-transpwood-project.eu/) codebases made available in [EESSI](https://www.eessi.io/).
Each code base will present a notebook with an example on how to run a specific tool or workflow with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Installation

### From Marketplace (not yet available)

Since Docker Desktop [v4.11.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#docker-desktop-4110) the AITW-JupyterLab Extension is available in Marketplace page:

- From Docker Desktop main window click on **Extensions** tab at left side menu
- If you have not installed any extension yet you will automatically jump to the **Manage**>**Browse** page
- If you have already installed some extension just click on **Manage** tab and then on **Browse** button at top right side of the window
- Look for **AITW-JupyterLab** extension (it will have the AITW project logo on the left)
- Click on install

### From command line

```bash
$ docker extension install aitranspwood/jupyter-docker-extension:1.0.0

## NOTES

- The CVMFS cache is configure to use up to 10GB of disk space on your machine, this is not yet configurable so make sure you have enough disk space available (on average ~3GB can be used when loading all examples).


## Usage

Once the extension is installed a new extension is listed at the pane Extension of Docker Desktop.
By clicking the project icon the extension main window will display the JupyterLab welcome page once it has loaded.


## Persistent storage

Any data added/created inside `/home/eessi-user` directory will be persistent against Docker Desktop restarts or Extension updates.
The data from the CVMFS cache is also persisted to make running software from EESSI smoother across restarts.

## Uninstall

### From Docker Desktop

- Navigate to the same **Extensions** > **Manage** page where you installed the extension.
- Click the three dots menu on the extension card and select **Uninstall**.

### From Command Line

```bash
$ docker extension uninstall aitranspwood/jupyter-docker-extension:1.0.0
Extension "Jupyter Notebook" uninstalled successfully
```
